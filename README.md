# Combinatorics through Guided Discovery

This project is intended to continue the work of the late Kenneth P. Bogart in providing an inquiry-based learning (IBL) approach to combinatorics. The `bogart` branch contains the files as distributed from the Dartmouth website, so please see that branch for files at this time.
